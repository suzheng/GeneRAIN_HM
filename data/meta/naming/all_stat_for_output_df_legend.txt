This table presents information on homolog gene pairs between human and mouse, as well as random gene pairs for comparative analysis. It includes details of embedding similarities derived from GPT models trained on gene expression data, and characteristics at the DNA level, such as CDS DNA sequence similarity, GC content, and transcript metrics. Additionally, the table includes information on the associations of gene pairs with phenotypes and diseases.

Column descriptions:
Gene pair group: Group of gene pairs, homolog or random gene pair.
Human gene: Symbol of the human gene in the gene pair.
Mouse gene: Symbol of the mouse gene in the gene pair.
Human homolog rank in mouse: Ranking position of the human gene's homolog among all mouse genes based on embedding similarity.
Mouse homolog rank in human: Ranking position of the mouse gene's homolog among all human genes based on embedding similarity.
