This table presents embedding similarities of human and mouse homologs, derived from models trained on gene expression data, and also includes similarities of their CDS DNA sequences.

Column descriptions:

Human gene: Symbol of the human gene in the gene pair.
Mouse gene: Symbol of the mouse gene in the gene pair.
Embedding similarity: Quantitative measure of the closeness of gene embeddings between human and mouse homologs. This is the average of 'Emb. simi. from Supervised align.' and 'Emb. simi. from GPT shared emb. + Supervised align.'.
Human homolog rank in mouse: Ranking position of the human gene's homolog among all mouse genes based on embedding similarity.
Mouse homolog rank in human: Ranking position of the mouse gene's homolog among all human genes based on embedding similarity.
DNA alignment score: The highest alignment score among transcripts of a human gene and its best-matched transcripts in its mouse homolog.
Mean transcript alignment score: The average alignment score across transcripts of a human gene and their corresponding best matches in its mouse homolog.
Group: Categorization of gene pairs based on DNA sequence similarity and RNA embedding similarity.
